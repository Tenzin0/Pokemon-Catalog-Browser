TODO:

Angular Command
command: 
- ng generate component name_of_component
- ng generate component folder_name/name_of_component (this place component in x folder)
- ng serve --open (directly opens the browser) 
- npm start (for webserver)


note: Cors
we need cors since we run backend and frontend on different port, so the browser tries to protect us from accessing different domain - so we need cors to bypass it

TODO:
- Create the card with pokemon information
- utlize bootstrap (column/rows) to uniformly place the cards
- add search-bar 
- develop auto-completion for search-bar
